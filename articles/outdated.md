The Brian Eno ["Glide" DX7 patch](http://17hex.net/2008/03/25/dx7-patches-from-brian-eno/) published in the Feb. 1987 issue of Keyboard Magazine is quite enchanting. It's fairly straightforward to enter the parameters manually even without an extensive knowledge of FM synthesis. It'll take about eight minutes and you will be rewarded with a very unique sound.
